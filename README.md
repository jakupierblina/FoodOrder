-Plan:

    This is a simple mobile app where you can order Italian food.

    We modified the plan which was to order by SMS (text) or phone call to just a simple order by email.

    When you run the app, the user will first need to register. The user’s profile will be stored and sorted
    in the database of the app. The database is refreshed every time the user runs the app, if the user runs 
    the application in another mobile, they will have to register again because each mobile has it's own memory
    size for installing new app. you have internet you will he able just to log in

    Once you are logged in on the app, the user will see a Navigation Drawer with the menu of the food the user 
    would like to order.

    The menu has options such as: TraditionalFood, Pizza, Pasta, ContenialFood. The user will be able to see their
    profile, to check the order history and sign out.

    When the user checks the the menu they will see a list with the options, there a picture of the food and the button
    to add it in your order. On the button above, you need to enter the amount the user wants to spend on the food the 
    order.

    Once the user has added to cart they will see the order in their history.

    Some pictures how the app looks like.
